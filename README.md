## Code for the project Login Page (TWO versions)

This is a private repo because we want our students to write the code themselves as much as possible. Only the coaches have access to private repos in this GitHub organisation.

The Login Page project has two levels of difficulty: 
* **basic version**: build the login page, including specific styling elements, and validate input fields (empty gives error message, email validation)
* **advanced version**: more complex validation, using success/failure icons

Suggestions are always welcome (henriette@migracode.org).

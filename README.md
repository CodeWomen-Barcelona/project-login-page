## Code for the project Login Page (has TWO main.js files)

This is a private repo because we want our students to write the code themselves as much as possible. Only the coaches have access to private repos in this GitHub organisation.

The Login Page project has two levels of difficulty: 
* students **(main.js file)**: build the login page, including specific styling elements, and validate input fields (empty gives error message)
* graduates **(main2.js file)**: more complex validation

This repo provides the code for the login page.

Suggestions are always welcome (henriette@migracode.org).
